The Importance of Secure Web Applications in Cybersecurity

In a digital era dominated by increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, the security of web applications has become a crucial component of data protection and online infrastructure security. Web applications are often targeted by cyber threats such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), brute force attacks, and the exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities.

A Secure Web Application provides a protected environment through robust authentication, advanced encryption, access control, and threat detection. This project was created to demonstrate and implement best practices in web security, using a set of 10 essential modules, each playing a critical role in safeguarding online applications.

2. Web Application Firewall (WAF) Simulation
3. Vulnerability Reporting Platform
4. Data Encryption/Decryption Tool
5. User Role-Based Access Control System
6. Secure File Storage System
7. Cyber Attack Simulation and Logging
8. Secure Comment System
9. Password Manager
11. WPScan
12. Xmlrcp-attack
